Lyrics
I love myself
I want you to love me
When I feel down
I want you above me
I search myself
I want you to find me
I forget myself
I want you to remind me
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you
I touch myself
Oh, I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You're the one who makes me come runnin'
You're the sun who makes me shine
When you're around, I'm always laughin'
I want to make you mine
I close my eyes
And see you before me
Think I would die
If you were to ignore me
A fool could see
Just how much I adore you
I'd get down on my knees
I'd do anything for you
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you
I touch myself
Oh, I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no, yeah
I love myself
I want you to love me
When I feel down
I want you above me
I searchâ€¦ More
